# connect4-four-game

A javascript grit based game
 
Built With:

  • HTML
  • CSS
  • JS
  
Synopsis:

A grid-based game in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Connect Four also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union) is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 

The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on for loops. If you want to learn how to use for loops effectively, please have a look at my code.

Motivation
This game was built to practice HTML, CSS, and JS, and to improve problem solving skills and consistent logical thinking.

Rules:

1) start as player One
2) You will take your go as player One
3) You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it
4) Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go
5) The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.

WE GOING:

basic html:- td,tr,div
basic css
javascript:-
        document.querySelector
        arrow functions
        for loops
        addEventListener
        
Future Improvements:

I want to:
  • Keep track and display each player's wins.
  • Add the ability to store a game to play later, using Firebase, local storage, or similar.
  • Add the ability to play live with another person remotely, using Firebase or similar.
